# Welcome to Scipion docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [scipion-em.github.io/docs](https://scipion-em.github.io/docs) :sparkles:.

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/content-markup-reference.md).


### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/scipion-em/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review.
